        <p>The following is a recipe that comes via Elise Bauer on Simply Recipes that my mom sent me ages for reasons I can no longer remember. I don't believe I have made it yet, but from the directions it seems quite good.</p>
        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <h3>For the Salad</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1 (15-ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1   (15-ounce) can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1/2 red onion, finely chopped (about 3/4 cup), soaked in water to take the edge off the onion</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks, finely chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
            <li>1 cup loosely packed, fresh, finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh finely chopped rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Dressing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar (more or less to taste)</li>
           <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Insructions</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the 3 different types of beans, the celery, onion (drained of soaking water), parsley, and rosemary.</li>
        <li>In a separate small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Add the dressing to the beans. Toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Transfer the salad to the refrigerator for several hours, to allow the beans to soak up the flavor of the dressing. Let come to close to room temperature to serve.</li>
        </ol>
