        <h2>A Taste of What's To Come</h2>
        <p>This specific recipe for no-bake cookies comes from my Grandma and is one of my favorite treats from childhood. The basic recipe is super easy and quick to make, the main ingrediants being:  cocoa, peanut butter and oats. Only a few minutes are required to prepare. Below the main recipe will be some suggestions from Mom on how to make them low-carb.</p>
        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>clock with a second hand or the timer on your phone</li>
               <li>wax paper, 2 sheets, about 18 inches long each</li> 
                <li>2 cups sugar</li>
                <li>3 T.(tablespoons) cocoa</li>
                <li>1/4 lb. (1 stick) butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
                <li>1 cup nuts, any kind, omitted if using crunchy peanut butter</li>
               <li>1 t.(teaspoon) vanilla</li> 
               <li>3 cup oats</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep all ingredients before beginning. Timing is important.</li>
            <li>Mix sugar and cocoa. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Put peanut butter, nuts, vanilla, and oats within easy reach of the stove, if possible.</li>
            <li> Melt butter. Add milk. Add sugar and cocoa mixture. Heat on medium heat. When bubbles begin to form, start timer for 2 minutes. *Note from Mom(Recipe calls for continuous stirring, but that is marked out. But I think it will burn if I don't.) Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Work quickly. Add peanut butter, nuts and vanilla. Drop by teaspoon onto wax paper, pressing to flatten. Let cool.</li>
        </ol>
