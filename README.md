Recipe for Grandma's famous No-Bake cookies, via Mom with a low carb twist added by her. Practice basic paragraph formatting and lists on rudimentary website.
Ingredients
clock with a second hand or the timer on your phone
wax paper, 2 sheets, about 18 inches long each.
2 cups sugar
3 T. cocoa
1/4 lb. (1 stick) butter
1/2 cup milk
1 cup peanut butter
1 cup nuts, any kind, omitted if using crunchy peanut butter
1 t. vanilla
3 cups oats
Directions
Prep all ingredients before beginning. Timing is important.

Mix sugar and cocoa. Set aside.

Put peanut butter, nuts, vanilla, and oats within easy reach of the stove, if possible.

Melt butter. Add milk. Add sugar and cocoa mixture. Heat on medium heat. When bubbles begin to form, start timer for 2 minutes. (Recipe calls for continuous stirring, but that is marked out. But I think it will burn if I don't.) Remove from heat.

Work quickly. Add peanut butter, nuts and vanilla. Drop by teaspoon onto wax paper, pressing to flatten. Let cool.

Notes
Will try Truvia for sugar, almond flour for oats next time I try to low-carb hack this.
